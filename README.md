ABOUT index.html

In my project, I created a Netflix-like homepage using HTML and CSS. The page consists of a navigation bar at the top with "Join Now" and "Sign In" buttons for user registration and login. I used fixed positioning for the navigation bar to keep it at the top of the viewport as the user scrolls.

The main content section of the page contains three sections: "Netflix's Top Movies," "Netflix's Top Series," and "India's Top Series." Each section displays a list of images representing the top movies and series. I used flexbox to arrange the images in a responsive and visually appealing layout.

To enhance the visual appeal, I added some CSS styles, including background colors, margins, padding, and text colors. The "Join Now" and "Sign In" buttons have a red background color with white text and a border to make them stand out. Similarly, I styled the other buttons and images to improve the overall look and feel of the page.

At the bottom of the page, I added a footer section with information about Netflix and its vast library of movies, TV shows, and more. The footer also contains a "JOIN NOW" button for users to easily access the registration page.

To make the page responsive, I used media queries and adjusted the layout and styles for smaller screens. This ensures that the page looks good and is user-friendly on various devices, including mobile phones and tablets.

Overall, my project demonstrates my skills in HTML and CSS, as I created an attractive and responsive Netflix-inspired homepage. The layout and styling make it easy for users to explore the top movies and series and encourage them to sign up or log in to Netflix.


ABOUT join.html

In my HTML and CSS project, I've created a "Join Now" page with a simple and sleek design. The page features a navigation bar at the top with a Netflix logo on the left, and I have styled the navigation links to be white in color and with a subtle margin on the right.

For the main content, I've added a form for user registration. The form includes input fields for the user's full name, date of birth, email, phone number, and password. To make it user-friendly, I have set required attributes for all input fields so that users must fill them out before submitting the form. Additionally, the email field is validated with a regex pattern to ensure it follows the correct format.

To enhance the form's appearance, I've styled the labels and input fields using CSS. The input fields have a width of 100%, padding, a subtle border, and rounded corners for a modern look. The "Sign Up" button has a red background color with white text to make it stand out and a border-radius of 4px for a smooth edge.

Furthermore, I've added a "Clear" button that allows users to reset the form fields without submitting it. I've also made the form centered on the page using max-width and margin properties to make it look clean and organized.

The overall page background is set to black, and the form section has a darker shade to give it a contrast. I've used a white color for the text to ensure it's readable against the dark background.

In conclusion, this "Join Now" page provides a user-friendly and visually appealing interface for users to sign up for Netflix. The form validation ensures that users provide the necessary information, and the form's design is clean and attractive, enhancing the overall user experience



ABOUT signin.html


As a web developer, I have created a simple Sign In page using HTML and CSS. The page starts with a navigation bar at the top, which has a black background color and contains our website's logo on the left. I've made the logo clickable, leading users back to the homepage.

The main content of the page is wrapped inside a div with the class "form." Within this form, I've included two input fields: one for the user's email and the other for their password. Both fields are required, so users must fill them before they can proceed with signing in.

To make the form look visually appealing, I've added some styling. The input fields have a width of 100%, and they have a slight border and rounded corners for a cleaner look. The "Sign In" button is the key element, styled with a red background color and white text. It has a modern, rounded appearance with no visible border.

Additionally, below the "Sign In" button, I've included a link labeled "Forgot Password?". This link provides users with the option to recover their password if they have forgotten it.

For the overall page appearance, I've kept it simple and elegant. The background is solid black, and the form has a dark gray background to make it stand out.

To make the page responsive, I've used relative units such as "vh" and "vw" for sizing the logo and elements. This ensures that the page will adapt well to different screen sizes and resolutions.

Overall, this Sign In page offers a clean and user-friendly design, and it will be easy for users to interact with and sign in to our website.
